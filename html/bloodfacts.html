    <ol>
      <li> A pint of blood is drawn from a donor.</li>
      <li> Blood is collected and labeled in a sterile bag.</li>
      <li> Blood is transported to a lab for testing and processing.</li>
      <li> Blood is processed and spun down into different components: plasma, red blood cells and platelets.</li>
      <li> Blood is tested to ensure it is safe for transfusion.</li>
      <li> Local hospitals place orders for blood based on specific needs.</li>
      <li> Blood products are stored and ready for transfusion. Platelets expire in 5 days, red blood cells in 42 days, and plasma in 2 years.</li>
      <li> Blood is transferred to patients. 1 blood donation has the potential to save 3 lives.</li>

    <h2 class="title">Benefits</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Donating blood has benefits for your emotional and physical health.

        Research has found further evidence of the health benefits that come
        specifically from donating blood.
    </p>

    <h2 class="title">Free health checkup</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        In order to give blood, you're required to undergo a health screening.
        A trained staff member performs this checkup. They'll check your:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>pulse</li>
        <li>blood pressure</li>
        <li>body temperature</li>
        <li>hemoglobin levels</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This free mini-physical can offer excellent insight into your health.
        It can effectively detect problems that could indicate an underlying
        medical condition or risk factors for certain diseases.
    </p>

    <p>Your blood is also tested for several diseases. These include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>hepatitis B</li>
        <li>hepatitis C</li>
        <li>HIV</li>
        <li>West Nile virus</li>
        <li>syphilis</li>
        <li>Trypanosoma cruzi</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 class="title">Side effects of donating blood</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        Blood donation is safe for healthy adults. There's no risk of
        contracting disease. New, sterile equipment is used for each donor.
        <br /><br />
        Some people may feel nauseous, lightheaded, or dizzy after donating
        blood. If this happens, it should only last a few minutes. You can lie
        down with your feet up at the until you feel better.
        <br /><br />
        You may also experience some bleeding at the site of the needle.
        Applying pressure and raising your arm for a couple of minutes will
        usually stop this. You may develop a bruise at the site.
        <br />
        Call the blood donation center if:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            You still feel lightheaded, dizzy, or nauseous after drinking,
            eating, and resting.
        </li>
        <li>
            You develop a raised bump or continue bleeding at the needle site.
        </li>
        <li>You have arm pain, numbness, or tingling.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="title">During the donation</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>
        You must register to donate blood. This includes providing
        identification, your medical history, and undergoing a quick physical
        examination. You'll also be given some information about blood
        donation to read. <br /><br />
        Once you're ready, your blood donation procedure will begin. Whole
        blood donation is the most common type of donation. This is because it
        offers the most flexibility. It can be transfused as whole blood or
        separated into red cells, platelets, and plasma for different
        recipients.
        <br /><br />
        For a whole blood donation procedure:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>
            You'll be seated in a reclining chair. You can donate blood either
            sitting or lying down.
        </li>
        <li>
            A small area of your arm will be cleaned. A sterile needle will then
            be inserted.
        </li>
        <li>
            You'll remain seated or lying down while a pint of your blood is
            drawn. This takes 8 to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            When a pint of blood has been collected, a staff member will remove
            the needle and bandage your arm.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        Other types of donation include:
        <br />
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>platelet donation (plateletpheresis)</li>
        <li>plasma donation (plasmapheresis)</li>
        <li>double red cell donation</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        These types of donations are performed using a process called
        apheresis. An apheresis machine is connected to both of your arms. It
        collects a small amount of blood and separates the components before
        returning the unused components back to you. This cycle is repeated
        several times over approximately two hours. <br /><br />
        Once your donation is complete, you'll be given a snack and a drink
        and be able to sit and rest for 10 or 15 minutes before you leave. If
        you feel faint or nauseous, you'll be able to lie down until you feel
        better.
    </p>

    <h2 class="title">What to know before you donate</h2>
    <hr />

    <ul>
        <li>

        <li>
            You have to weigh at least 110 pounds and be in good health to

        </li>
        <li>
            You need to provide information about medical conditions and any
            medications you're taking. These may affect your eligibility to
            donate blood.
        </li>
        <li>
            You must wait at least 8 weeks between whole blood donations and 16
            weeks between double red cell donations.
        </li>
        <li>
            Platelet donations can be made every 7 days, up to 24 times per
            year.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
